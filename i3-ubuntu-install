apt install i3-gaps (newer i3 version).
cp .config/i3/config into local
cp .config/picom.conf into local
install rofi, i3lock-fancy
may manually need to compile `picom` (composite thing which fixes screen tearing also)
install i3-swap-focus python script, or just cp from here to /usr/local/bin/i3-swap-focus

cp /home/rcornall/.startup and crontab -e:
@reboot /home/rcornall/.startup

note: gnome-control-center is the settings which persist with networkmanager. (which still is laggy)
gpclient is vpn gui.
